# Initial Changes

At this point, you now have your chromstream repository on GitHub and locally on your machine. Now it's time to start making some modifications.

### README

The first thing to do is update the README (`/README.md`), which should contain a user-friendly summary of what your package is all about. This can be whatever you want. Feel free to be creative!
